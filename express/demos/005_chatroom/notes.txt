1) have node.js render index.ejs file that has the html content for the client when the client requests '/'

	routings/index.ejs

	app.get("/", function(req, res){
		res.render('index', {});
	});
2) In the client code have a user input for the users name

<script>
	var name = prompt("What is your name");
</script>

3) have the client emit information to the server "got_a_new_user", pass name to the server

	<script>
		var name = prompt("What is your name");
		var socket = io.connect();
		socket.emit('got_a_new_user', { name: name});
		socket.on()
	</script>

4) have the server listen for "got_a_new_user", 

	4.1) have the server broadcast an event called "new_user" to the client, name of the new user attached to this event. 
		socket.

		socket.on('got_a_new_user', function(data){
			socket.broadcast.emit('new_user', {new_user_name: req.data.name})
		}), 
	4.2) have the name/session id of the new user in a variable/array/hash called users 

		var users = {};
		users.append(new info)
	4.3) to the server who sent the request, emit an event called "existing_users" with all the users data. 



5) have the client listen for an event called "new_user", when this event gets triggered, have the client render this information in jQuery somewhere in HTML

6) 	have the server listen for an event of disconnect and when this occurs broadcast to all clients an event "disconnect_user", with some data (name of the disconnected user) (We'll probably need to pass a session id or something else to identify a user)

7) Have the client listen for an event "disconnect_user", have client remove proper jquery box for user
