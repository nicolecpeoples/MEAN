/*To create an object, we just use {}. We also attached a key (helloFunc) that will let us access the function, which, because it’s now inside an object, we refer to as a method.

Because we’re giving up the automatic numerical indexing power of an array, each item (value) in a JavaScript object must have some sort of reference (key). JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is extremely important to understand because anything can be represented using it (that’s because objects can contain other objects and arrays). And it’s the data format of choice for most APIs!

We can create an empty javascript object using {}. The keys in javascript objects are called ‘properties’ or ‘attributes’. A property in the object can store/hold a string, number, array, function or even another object. Consider the codes below.
