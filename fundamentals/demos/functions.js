/*Remember: Functions are first class
Functions in Javascript are known as “First-Class”. This means that they can basically go wherever they want!

Functions can be stored as standalone functions (like above), as the value of variables, or as attributes in a JavaScript object (where they're known as methods)
Functions can be passed as arguments to functions (known as a callback)
Functions can be returned from functions. (This is creating what’s called a closure, which we’ll discuss later.)
