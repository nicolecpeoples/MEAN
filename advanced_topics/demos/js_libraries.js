JavaScript Libraries
These three libraries interact with DOM elements and attempt to help structure how data flows through your site and how you build out Javascript elements.

Angular: Lots of companies prefer hiring developers that have some exposure to Angular. We’ll do more with this later in the MEAN course: http://angularjs.org/

React: A view rendering template that uses a virtual DOM! (Developed by Facebook) At the simplest level you can think of React a lot like the block building model we used to efficiently build out sites in the HTML Fundamentals, but done in JavaScript! This is great, because you can reuse blocks of code easily. https://facebook.github.io/react/

BackBone: http://backbonejs.org/ “Backbone is an attempt to discover the minimal set of data-structuring (models and collections) and user interface (views and URLs) primitives that are generally useful when building web applications with JavaScript.” – From backbone’s website.

jQuery forms the core and provides inspiration for many of other libraries listed here - it is definitely worth checking out in more depth as well.

jQuery: “jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions of people write JavaScript.” – from jQuery’s website: https://jquery.com/

In addition there are two HTML tags that are heavily driven by

<canvas> and <svg>

The libraries below use these elements to generate cool effects:

d3js (Data Drive Documents): https://d3js.org/ (svg)

PaperJS - http://paperjs.org/ (canvas)

In addition:

WebRTC - http://www.webrtc.org/

With this technology, you can create voice chat, google hangout type of app, all with a few lines of JavaScript! This is really amazing and you could play around with this for your project.
