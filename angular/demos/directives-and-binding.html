<!-- Directives 
	Directives direct something to happen within your HTML -->

<!-- Compiling Angular
	Angular documentation refers to both templates and views. Simply put: angular templates get compiled to angular views by the browser. -->

<!-- Placing the ng-app direct and using Angular
	To tell our HTML it is being controlled by Angular, we have to use the ng-app directive. This is like is the ignition key for angular, and allows other angular directives to work with in the scope of this main directive. Letâ€™s make an HTML document called angular.html and make it look like this: -->

	<html ng-app=''>
    <head>
      <script src="bower_components/angular/angular.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h3>{{ 49567 * 2243 }} </h3>
        <h3 ng-bind='49567 * 2243'></h3>
    </body>
</html>


<!-- ng-bind 
	Double brackets are a way to execute Angular code that will be rendered into HTML. Load this page to see how the page renders! The same effect can be achieved using a ng-bind directive. There is no advantage to one or the other in terms of speed, but the double curly brackets might show up on a slow-loading browser before Angular gets completely rendered, whereas ng-bind wonâ€™t. Play with both and see what you like.  -->

<!-- Data binding, ng-init and ng-repeat  
	Data Binding: allows angular to keep track of app data as a variable. As a default the devs of Angular created a variable object called $scope. 
	Most directives have a scope: usually from the tag that they are initial bound to, through the end of that tag. The $scope object can hold data related to the directives scope.

	We can add data to the $scope object using the ng-init directive. You will not see this directive very much in practice, but it is a fantastic introductory tool. Letâ€™s make our angular.html file look like this now: -->

	<html ng-app=''>
	<head>
	      <script src="bower_components/angular/angular.js"></script>
	</head>
	<body>
	  <div ng-init="students=['Mike', 'John', 'Trey', 'India']">
	    <ul>
	        <li ng-repeat="student in students">{{student}}</li>
	    </ul>   
	  </div>
	</body>
	</html>

	<!-- ng init allows us to initialize data and repeat allows us to loop through the data -->

<html ng-app=''>
<head>
    <script src="bower_components/angular/angular.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <div ng-init="students=[{name: 'Mike', age: 34}, {name: 'John', age: 24}, {name: 'Trey', age: 24}, {name: 'India', age: 35}]">
    <ul>
        <li ng-repeat="student in students">{{student.name}}, {{student.age}}</li>
    </ul>   
  </div>
</body>
</html>
