Services are awesome!
A list of prebuilt services are here: https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service

Ones that we commonly use:

$http
This service allows us to make AJAX calls to different APIâ€™s (in our case: our server!). It is extremely useful. Compare $.ajax in jQuery

http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/

to

https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$http

$location
This service allows us to change the window URL using JavaScript.

https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$location

$timeout and $interval
These services are akin to window.setTimeout and window.setInterval, so are useful for generating timers.

https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$timeout

https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$interval

Add-ons Have Other Good Services:
ngRoute has to very useful methods:

$routeProvider - a provider that will make AJAX calls to load partial views.

$routeParams -allows us to get parameters from URLs.

ngCookie $ngCookie - allows us to set cookies easily.

And many more!

No worries about spending too much time looking into all of them, we will cover some of these in the next tab.
